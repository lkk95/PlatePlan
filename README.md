# PlatePlan:fork_and_knife::calendar:

This is a React web app for planning meals each day and week. 

## Why you should use PlatePlan
With PlatePlan you can create your meals for a specific day and even add information about the recipe, so you don't have to search for hours in your recipe folders. With the practical shoppinglist feature ingredients that you enter with creating a recipe will be added to a separate shopping list.
